  Nature's way,a chain of stores selling health food and products ,is opening its new franchise in the town of plainsville.It claims that the residents of plainsville
lead healthy lives and its new store in that town will be profitable.But this particular claim is not completely convincing as it is based on certain assumptions ,
which are not totally supported by the facts given in the argument.
 
  Firstly, it is stated that sales of running shoes and excercise clothing are at all-time highs.This information is meant to convince us that the shoes and clothing
purchased are only used for health related purposes and excercises ,which means the people are health concious.But one cannot merely conclude that the shoes and 
clothing are used only for excercises and not for other reasons.Moreover,the all-time high sales doesnot need to mean that most of the people are buying for excercises

  Secondly, it is informed that local health club has more members than ever and weight training and aerobics classes are always full.This is supposed to mean that 
majority of the people are taking health care. But one can argue that this part of the people doesnot represent the whole population of the town.There is also no 
information about the number of clubs and their class strengths in the town.

  Finally, it is said that school children are required to attend fitness-for-life program,which emphasizes the benifits of regular excercise.From this, we are 
supposed to assume that children will purchase more health products from the store.But one can argue that generally children are not the direct and regular customers
 of health store.We can also argue that children may not be interested in the program,rather the reason might be pressure from parents and school.

  Besides this, it is claimed that,as plainsville town people lead healthy lives,the store will be profitable.But,just the health conciousness of people doesnot mean
that the store will be successfull.There may be other compititors for this new store.It also depends upon the interest of the people in spending for health food and 
products.

  Therefore,the claim that the new franchise will be profitable in plainsville,is not logically substantiated by the facts presented in the arguments.One would require
more information about the people of the town on the health conciousness to prove the assumptions to be true,which can be obtained by surveying the town people about
their interest on buying healthproducts from the health stores.
